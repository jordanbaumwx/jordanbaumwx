Hello I'm Jordan Baumgardner. I am a Meteorolgist by schooling, but have been working in software development and engineering for over 4 years now. 

I'm currently focused on learning Next.js as my next new framework; but also am spreading time between reading AWS Solution Architecture material and 
applying technical knowledge to problems in the weather industry (with regards to Software).
